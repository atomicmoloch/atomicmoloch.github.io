title: "Liquid Democracy: a Brief Introduction"
---
A liquid democracy is a political system in which the maximal control of
individual voting power characteristic of direct democracy is preserved while
also allowing for voters to delegate their voting power---both that which is
inherent and that which is delegated from others.
It represents a variation on direct democracy and republican government that
combines the granular and individualistic characteristics of voting within a
direct democracy with the practical concessions that make republican government
a superior system to unaltered direct democracy.
Liquid democracy also represents an expansion and evolution of the concept of
proxy voting
(commonly used in situations such as shareholder votes, where every shareholder
has one vote but few shareholders actually choose to vote on every issue
requiring a shareholder vote),
where a voter can delegate their voting power once to a proxy but a voter cannot
delegate their own proxy votes.
