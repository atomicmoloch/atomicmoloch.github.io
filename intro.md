title: "Liquid Democracy: a Brief Introduction"
---
A liquid democracy is a political system in which the maximal control of
individual voting power characteristic of direct democracy is preserved while
also allowing for voters to delegate their voting power---both that which is
inherent and that which is delegated from others.
It represents a variation on direct democracy and republican government that
combines the granular and individualistic characteristics of voting within a
direct democracy with the practical concessions that make republican government
a superior system to unaltered direct democracy.

Liquid democracy also represents an expansion and evolution of the concept of
proxy voting
(commonly used in situations such as shareholder votes, where every shareholder
has one vote but few shareholders actually choose to vote on every issue
requiring a shareholder vote),
where a voter can delegate their voting power once to a proxy but a voter cannot
delegate their own proxy votes.
In a representative democracy,
representatives are determined once per election cycle and represent a complete
delegation of the abstract voting power of a particular constituency of people.
In a liquid democracy, by contrast, constituencies are amorphous and fluid
because any voter can delegate their vote on a particular policy or group
thereof to another.
And voters never give up their voting power when they delegate itâ€”rather, they
are able to reclaim and reallocate that power as circumstances dictate.
These two properties should allow for better representation,
more informed decisionmaking, and less corruption than in the political systems
typical of the *status quo*.

The ideals of liquid democracy can be expressed through four fundamental
principles (as given by
[Blum and Zuber][bz]):
1. **Direct democracy:** all voters are able to vote on specific policy issues.
2. **Flexible delegation:** all voters have the option to delegate their votes to
    another voter, and are able to do so for particular votes, by policy area,
    or completely.
3. **Meta-delegation:** voters to whom votes are delegated can further delegate
    these votes.
4. **Instant recall:** any voter is able to cancel any of their individual
    delegations at any time.

To satisfy these ideals, a liquid democracy mechanism must receive particular
pieces of information from voters.
[Brubach, Ballarin, and Nazeer][bbn] proposes a [model](bbn_model) for these
systems that standardizes how voters express their decisions to the mechanism
and how the mechanism resolves certain common problems that occur in liquid
democracy mechanisms.
These assumptions provide a common basis by which
[Brubach, Ballarin, and Nazeer][bbn] can evaluate different liquid democracy
mechanisms.

# Justifications and Premises
There are two independent arguments outlined by [Blum and Zuber][bz] in favor of
the use of liquid democracy as
a mechanism for sociopolitical decision-making.
The epistemic argument is based on the ideal that a legislature
is to discover the truth and incorporate that truth into legislation designed to
further the common good.
The epistemic argument also recognizes that individual decisionmakers can err
and make decisions that run counter to the common good.
