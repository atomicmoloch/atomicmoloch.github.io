# Existing Mechanisms

The paper starts by analyzing the properties of the two liquid democracy mechanisms that have been put into real world use in any substantive capacity: Google Votes and LiquidFeedback. It then covers two further mechanisms that have been proposed in papers: [GreedyCap][kahng] and a [fluid mechanics model][golz].

## Google Votes

Google Votes was used internally by Google between 2012 and 2015 to vote to make inconsequential community decisions, such as those regarding meals, snacks, and internal project logos. It was implemented as a web app on the internal corporate Google+ network, in an opaque fashion that leaves ambiguity regarding some of the precise workings of its central delegation mechanism. In particular, it is ambiguous how the mechanism chooses among multiple possible delegation paths in the case of delegation cycles.
The Google Votes mechanism guarentees single-path explainability for each voter's individual vote, but cannot do so for all votes delegated to a voter, as proven in [Theorem 5.1](theorems).

## LiquidFeedback

## GreedyCap

## Fluid Mechanics
